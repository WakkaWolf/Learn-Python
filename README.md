# Learn-Python
My first language


I commented blocks of code in some subjects so i could delete them and run them independently and excuse me if im doing this wrong, its my first time using github


I hope to get a basic understanding of Python, Java, C++, and Golang before I get to highschool. Im thirteen atm of this record.
