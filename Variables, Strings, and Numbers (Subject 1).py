"This is a string"#a statement inbetween--> ("") or ('')
'This a string too'

print("\tHello World")#adds a tab worth of whitespace (blank areas) in output/console

# both can be stacked (\n and \t) and used in same string

print("Hello \nWorld")#makes a newline appear 


rdm3=' eric '# (-) represents the border of whitespace


print(rdm3)# output is - eric -

print(3+2)#addition


print(3*2)#multiplication


print(3-2)#subtraction


print(3/2)#division (only applies in Python 3)


print(3**2)#exponents


print(5//2)#this makes the answer always an integer so any floats get removed, result is 2


print(5%2)#this takes the remainder of a (//) equation so it would be "1" since u take out 4 and 1 is left
 

#Floating-Point Numbers


print(.1+.3)#works like normal decimals
